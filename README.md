# wasm_lua

This is made with `teal`, you can use the provided `.lua` file, or compile the `.tl` file according to the instructions for [teal](https://github.com/teal-language/tl#running)


## Why would you do that ?

Well, a lot of programs (like games) only run `lua` as addons/plugins/mods, but I really like writing Rust that is able to run in WASM. So I asked myself if I could not make a WASM VM in lua so that I could target those games with Rust mods.
